NOTE: Breadboard V+ V- lines not connected across all of breadboard. only until half of it. Connect two halves with two wires.

Piezo setup:
	1) Used inverting amplifier configuration with LM358P.
	2) Red of piezo to ground, black to amplifier input.
	3) amplifier Vcc +5V from arduino, GND on other terminal.
	4) Used Ri = 100ohms Rf=10000ohms. Gain = 100.
	5) Detects glass by counting spikes from Piezo. Typically >7 for glass and less 	for plastic.
	
Inductive setup:
	1) Need 1kohm resistor
	2) use LED for metal detection.

IR setup:
	Check IRSetup screenshot.
	1) need 15kohm resistor and 180ohm resistor.
	2) Use two similar setups to cancel out distance dependency. Take difference between two sensors (1 with blockade and one for reference.)
	3) For differential opamp, use 100ohm R3/R1, and 120kohm R2/R4 for a total gain of  1200.
